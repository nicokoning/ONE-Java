OPTIMIZED NESTING ENVIRONMENT (ONE)

The optimized nesting environment (ONE) is a new Ilumbra led format for storing all volumes, textures and scene parameters for the correct display of each 3D volumetric model.  The format stores a list of volumes (region in the scene) and their associated textures.  The texture(s) used by a volume is determined by the volume’s TEXTURE_ID_X parameter (see below).
The code provided here allows you to read a ONE file into your planetarium software.  A full document on the format can be found at:
